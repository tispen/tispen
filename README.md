### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I am Julia
#### I am backend-developer (py/java) and in free time i am coding ml and android

Here you can find my android application in java, a couple of sites (php/js+mysql) and a few small apps/bots on py/java using machine learning. Web full stack with php is definitely not interesting to me

Skills: JAVA / PYTHON / SQL / ML

 ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on this page.
